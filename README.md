# GutenBot
A Discord bot for accessing Project Gutenberg built for HackUTD VII.
# From Devpost Submission
## Inspiration
Books are tedious. Talking about books is tedious too, especially online. If a teacher, study partner, or friend asks to consult some specific part of a book with you, you can bet there's a disruptive wave of different editions, conflicting page numbers, and inconvenience. I wanted to recreate the feeling of leaning over and pointing at a passage for someone in Discord. More specifically, I got inspiration from a language-learning server where people frequently used bots connected to dictionaries seamlessly in conversation to talk about specific words. I thought something similar could be done with ebooks.
## What it does
There are three basic functions of GutenBot: storing a Gutenberg ID for some work, searching through the body of that work, and managing a collection of excerpts.
GutenBot is able to store an ID either through having it directly set, or allowing a user to search through the Project Gutenberg catalog using a title or author.
Next, it's able to highlight matches for a keyword or quotation. The number of matches and context surrounding the match can be customized.
Finally, there is a system to add, delete, and display a collection of excepts and annotations across all the works accessed.
## Challenges
The hardest challenge to overcome was dealing with Project Gutenberg itself. I do not have much experience with large amounts of data, and went down countless dead ends and wild goose chases to get the project to the state it's in now.
## What's next for GutenBot
I can easily see the basic structure of GutenBot repurposed for some other library than Project Gutenberg. I can also see potential features on the Discord side of things, like multi-person comment threads, or the ability for teachers to assign annotations of certain texts.
